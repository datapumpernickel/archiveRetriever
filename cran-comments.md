  Due to changes to my university's emailing system, my current maintainer email address for the R-package archiveRetriever (lukas.isermann@mzes.uni-mannheim.de) has been changed to a read-only address from which I am unable to send emails. Accordingly, I would like to update my current maintainer email address and change it to lukas.isermann@uni-mannheim.de. I have given notice of the change to CRAN-submissions@R-project.org in advance.
